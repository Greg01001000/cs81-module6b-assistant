### CS 81 Module 6 Assignment 6B: Personal Assistant, by GregH, 7/16/25

#### What made your assistant “personal” to you?

Naming it "Eddie" helped, because that's the name of an intelligent, interactive computer with a "Genuine People Personality" in the book, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Writing its output messages to mimic that fictional computer revived pleasant memories of that book and BBC series.

#### What challenges did you face using 'this'?

The 'this' keyword was not challenging; it worked the way I expected. (I took Java Programming in the spring.) The most challenging part was trying to formulate elegant conditional logic in the completeTask() method--I wanted to display a message that all tasks are done if the method is called when no tasks are in the task list, and also if only one task is in the list, meaning that the final task is being done and removed from the list. So there are three possible courses of action: (1) Complete a task, but not all done; (2) Complete the last task and display the 'all done' message, or (3) display the 'all done' message because no tasks are in the list. The proper course is determined by evaluating one property (length of the task list), but no one logic structure can provide those three possible courses directly from one conditional evaluation. So it requires two conditional evaluations (I used two 'if' statements). And those evaluations, and removing and logging the completed task, use the 'this' keyword.

#### Which method would you improve or expand?

I would add a display message to addTask() to say which task was just added, and I would enable it to add multiple tasks at once. It would also be good to have a method which nicely displays the tasks in the list.
