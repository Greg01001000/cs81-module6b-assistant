CS 81 Module 6 Assignment 6B: Personal Assistant, by GregH, 7/16/25

**assistant.js** demonstrates modern JavaScript class syntax to create a PersonalAssistant object with properties and methods to add and remove tasks from a list and track the user's reported mood. 

**REFLECTION.md** has my answers to questions about personalizing the PersonalAssistant, what was challenging in writing the code, and how to improve the PersonalAssistant.
